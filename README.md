*This repository stores work done by Ye Huang in CSC413H5*

CSC413 is the continueation of CSC311 taught at UofT, where we study,implement, and prove deep neural network structures and its applications.

**CSC413 Course Description:**

An introduction to neural networks and deep learning. Backpropagation and automatic differentiation. Architectures: convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks. Methods for improving optimization and generalization. Neural networks for unsupervised and reinforcement learning.

**Material taught in CSC413(on-going):**

Python(Numpy,Pandas,Torch)

Multi-Layer Percptron Neural Network(MLP)

Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
...

**Breakdown of Assignments:**

*Note: the breakdown gives keywords of what an assignment was on, and the keywords follow the same order as the question given in the assignment*
